# 0x07. Networking basics #0:globe_with_meridians:

**INTRODUCTION**
The project covered the following topics:
- ***OSI Model***
  - Covered the OSI Model, including its definition, the number of layers it consists of, and its organizational structure. It provided a comprehensive understanding of the OSI Model and its organization, highlighting its significance in networking and communication systems.

- ***Local Area Networks(LAN)***
  - Covered the basics of Local Area Networks (LANs), including their definition, typical usage scenarios, and geographical size. It provided an understanding of how LANs are used for computer networking within a limited geographic area.

- ***Wide Area Networks(WAN)***
  - Focused on WAN (Wide Area Network) and covered the following key aspects: understanding the concept of a WAN, exploring its typical usage, and examining its typical geographical size. It provided a comprehensive overview of WAN, its applications, and the geographic scale at which it is typically implemented.

- ***Internet***
  - Covered the Internet, including its definition and importance. It explained IP addresses and their two types, IPv4 and IPv6. Additionally, it explored the concepts of localhost, subnets, and the reasons behind the creation of IPv6.

- ***TCP/UDP***
  - Covered the following topics related to data transfer protocols and network connectivity: the two main protocols used for IP data transfer (TCP and UDP), their main difference, the concept of ports, memorization of SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS port numbers, and a commonly used tool/protocol for checking network device connectivity.
