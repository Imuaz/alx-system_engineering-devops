- [Server](./concepts/server.md)

**Background**

In the sysadmin/devops track projects, the project requirements included the ability to create a diagram illustrating the web stack that was built. Furthermore, it was essential to provide an explanation of the function and purpose of each component within the stack. Additionally, understanding system redundancy was crucial, including its importance in ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. Lastly, familiarity with various acronyms such as LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), SPOF (Single Point of Failure), and QPS (Queries Per Second) was required. Overall, these projects emphasized a comprehensive understanding of the web stack, its components, system redundancy, and relevant acronyms.
