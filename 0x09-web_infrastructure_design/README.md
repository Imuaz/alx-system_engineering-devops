**0. Simple web stack**
- [0-simple_web_stack](./0-simple_web_stack): A designed single-server web infrastructure that is capable of hosting a website accessible through the domain `www.foobar.com`. The infrastructure utilizes a shared resource model, where both the database and application server components leverage the CPU, RAM, and SSD resources provided by the server.

It is important to note that the current configuration does not include any firewalls or SSL certificates for network protection. While the infrastructure efficiently serves the website, it is recommended to implement appropriate security measures, such as firewalls and SSL certificates, to safeguard the server's network and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data transmission.

- **Some specifics About This Infrastructure**
  - What is a server?
    - A server is a computer or system that provides services or resources to other devices or ***clients*** on a network.
  
  - What is the role of the domain name?
    - A domain name is a unique and human-friendly identifier used to locate and access websites or online services on the internet. It serves as a more memorable alternative to the numerical IP addresses that computers use to communicate with each other.
  
  - What type of DNS record `www` is in `www.foobar.com`?
    - The `www.foobar.com` is an alias for the domain `foobar.com`. The former uses a **CNAME (Canonical Name) record**, indicating that it points to the latter, which uses an **A (Adress) record** type to associate the IPv4 address `173.231.209.34` with the domain `foobar.com`. This can be checked by running ``dig www.foobar.com``
  
  - What is the role of the web server?
    - A web server is a software or hardware component that accepts requests through HTTP or secure HTTP (HTTPS) protocols and responds by providing the content of the requested resource or returning an error message when necessary. It acts as the intermediary between clients and the web content they are accessing.

  - What is the role of the application server?
    - The role of an application server is to host and execute applications, responding to client requests by providing the content of the requested resource or returning error messages. It acts as a software or hardware component that handles the runtime environment and services required for applications to run and interact with clients.

  - What is the role of the database?
    - The role of a database is to store, manage, and organize structured data efficiently. It provides a structured and secure environment for storing and retrieving data, allowing applications to store, update, and retrieve information as needed.

  - What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
    - The server communicates with the user's computer over the internet network using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which is a key component of the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol suite.

- **the issues with this infrastructure:**
  - SPOF:
    - The Single Point of Failure (SPOF) in the single-serve infrastructure design is the reliance on a single server. If this server fails or experiences issues, the entire infrastructure and website hosted on it become inaccessible. There is no redundancy or backup server to ensure continuous availability, making it vulnerable to disruptions and downtime.

  - Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted):
    - During maintenance, such as deploying new code and restarting the web server, downtime occurs, rendering the server temporarily unavailable for handling client requests. Downtime refers to the period when the server is not accessible, impacting user access to the website. Measures like scheduling maintenance during low traffic times can minimize user disruptions.

  - Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic.
    - The issue "Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic" means that the single-server infrastructure is unable to handle a large influx of requests effectively, resulting in performance degradation or downtime.

**1. Distributed web infrastructure**
- [1-distributed_web_infrastructure](./1-distributed_web_infrastructure): A designed three-server web infrastructure for `www.foobar.com` includes a web server (Nginx), an application server, a load balancer (HAproxy), and a MySQL database. Nginx serves static files and handles incoming requests, while HAproxy distributes traffic across the servers for optimal resource utilization. The application server hosts the code base, generating dynamic content and executing server-side logic. The MySQL database efficiently manages and stores the website's data. This infrastructure design ensures improved performance, scalability, and fault tolerance by distributing the workload, utilizing specialized components, and implementing a robust database management system. Overall, it enables a smooth and responsive website experience for users while accommodating growth and providing reliability.

- **some specifics about this infrastructure:**
  - For every additional element, why you are adding it?
    - A caching layer, such as Redis or Memcached, can be added between the application server and the database in order to enhance the performance and response times of the web infrastructure. By caching frequently accessed data or computed results, this layer reduces the workload on the database and accelerates the retrieval of information, resulting in faster response times for users.

  - What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
    - The load balancer, specifically HAProxy, is configured with the Round Robin distribution algorithm. HAProxy evenly distributes incoming requests across the available servers in a cyclic manner to achieve balanced resource utilization. This algorithm ensures that each server receives an equal share of the incoming traffic, preventing any individual server from becoming overloaded and promoting efficient request processing across the server pool.

  - Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both.
    - The HAProxy load balancer is configured for an Active-Active setup instead of an Active-Passive setup.
      - Active-Active setups can provide higher capacity, improved performance, and better load distribution, as all nodes actively handle traffic. They are well-suited for scenarios where maximizing resource utilization and handling high traffic volumes are important.
      - Active-Passive setups prioritize failover and redundancy, ensuring uninterrupted service in the event of a node failure. This setup may be preferred when rapid failover and fault tolerance are crucial.

  - How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
    - A Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) database cluster consists of a primary/master server that handles read and write operations, and replica/slave servers that receive replicated data changes from the primary server. Replica servers are used for read operations, improving performance. The primary server's changes are replicated asynchronously to the replicas, ensuring data consistency. In case of primary server failure, a replica can be promoted as the new primary server, ensuring high availability.

  - What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
    - The primary node handles write operations, ensuring data modifications are applied and maintained. The replica node, on the other hand, handles read operations, reducing the workload on the primary node and improving performance by distributing the read traffic across replicas.

- **issues with this infrastructure:**
  - Where are SPOF
    - The potential single points of failure (SPOFs) in this infrastructure are the load balancer and the database server.

    If the load balancer fails, it can disrupt the distribution of incoming traffic to the web and application servers, resulting in service unavailability.To mitigate this, implementing redundancy or high availability for the load balancer, such as using multiple load balancers in a failover configuration, can ensure continuous traffic distribution even if one load balancer fails.

    Similarly, If the database server experiences issues or downtime, it can lead to data unavailability and impact the functionality of the website. Implementing a replicated or clustered database setup can address this issue. With replication, data is replicated across multiple database servers, providing redundancy and allowing for failover to a replica server in case the primary database server fails.

  - Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
    - The security issues with this infrastructure include the absence of a firewall and lack of HTTPS encryption, leading to increased vulnerability to cyber attacks, higher risks of data breaches and privacy breaches, potential compliance and legal issues, and loss of user trust. Implementing these security measures is essential to protect the infrastructure, safeguard user data, and maintain a secure and trustworthy environment.

  - No monitoring
    - The absence of monitoring in the infrastructure hinders the ability to track performance, identify issues, and ensure smooth operation. It increases the risk of undetected problems, downtime, and degraded performance, impacting user experience and hindering timely troubleshooting and optimization. Monitoring is vital for proactive issue identification and maintaining a reliable and high-performing infrastructure.
