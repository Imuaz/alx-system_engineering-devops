# 0x0F. Load balancer:traffic_light:

## Concepts
- **Load balancer**
Ever wonder how Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter and other web giants are handling such huge amounts of traffic? They donâ€™t have just one server, but tens of thousands of them. In order to achieve this, web traffic needs to be distributed to these servers, and that is the role of a load-balancer.

## Requirements:round_pushpin:
**General**
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`

## Tasks:page_with_curl:

**0. Double the number of webservers**
- [0-custom_http_response_header](./0-custom_http_response_header): Bash script that installs and configures Nginx on a server with a custom HTTP response header.
  - Contains a custom HTTP header named `X-Served-By`
  - the value of the HTTP header is the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
  
**1. Install your load balancer**
- [1-install_load_balancer](./1-install_load_balancer): Bash script that installs and configures HAproxy on a server.
  - Distributes requests using a roundrobin algorithm
  - It allows the HAproxy management via an init script
- [this tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/set-hostname.html) can be followed in other to configure the servers with a right hostnames.

**2. Add a custom HTTP header with Puppet**
- [2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp](./2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp): Puppet manifest that configures a brand new Ubuntu machine.
  - Creates a custom HTTP header response
  - The name of the custom HTTP header will be `X-Served-By`
  - The value of the custom HTTP header will be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
