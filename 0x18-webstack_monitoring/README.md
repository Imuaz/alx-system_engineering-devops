- [Monitoring](../0x09-web_infrastructure_design/concepts/monitoring.md)
- [Server](../0x09-web_infrastructure_design/concepts/server.md)

**Introduction**

The project focused on the importance of monitoring and covered two main areas in monitoring. It explained the purpose and significance of access logs for a web server, such as Nginx, and how they capture information about incoming requests and client activities. Additionally, the project discussed error logs for a web server, such as Nginx, and their role in recording errors, warnings, and other critical events that occur during server operation. Overall, the project provided a comprehensive understanding of monitoring and the specific use of access logs and error logs in web server management.
