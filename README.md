# System Engineering and DevOps - Bash, Scripting, Web Stack/Web Stack Debugging, Networking & Security, CI/CD

**Background**

This repository contains programs written for the System Engineering and DevOps track for the ALX SE Program. These projects deal with Bash and practicing writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. I was taught about the OSI model and various Linux networking tools. Furthermore, discussions covered the configuration of a distributed system consisting of two web servers and one load balancer for the deployment of projects like Airbnb, using Nginx, HAProxy, certbot, ufw, and MySQL. The specific list of projects included is as follows:
